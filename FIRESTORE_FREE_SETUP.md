# Setting Up Firestore FREE (No Payment Method Required)

## Important: Firestore Free Tier Does NOT Require Payment

Firebase offers a **Spark Plan (Free)** that doesn't require a credit card.

## How to Enable Firestore Without Payment Method

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console
1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: `astro-pwa-hp`

### Step 2: Enable Firestore
1. Click **"Firestore Database"** in left sidebar
2. Click **"Create database"**
3. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you see **"Spark plan"** selected (not Blaze)
4. If you see a payment prompt:
   - Look for "Continue with Spark plan" or "Start in test mode"
   - **DO NOT** click "Upgrade to Blaze"
   - The free tier is available without payment

### Step 3: Choose Mode
- Select **"Start in test mode"** (for development)
- This is FREE and doesn't require payment

### Step 4: Select Location
- Choose the closest region to your users
- Click **"Enable"**

## If You're Still Asked for Payment

This might happen if:
1. You accidentally selected "Blaze plan" (pay-as-you-go)
2. You're trying to enable a paid feature

**Solution:** Make sure you're on the **Spark plan** (free tier)

## Free Tier Limits (No Payment Required)
- ✅ 50,000 reads/day
- ✅ 20,000 writes/day
- ✅ 1 GB storage
- ✅ No credit card needed
