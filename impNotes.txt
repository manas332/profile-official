*Products table is hardcoded and named as "Products" in the database and the codebase.

Tasks for tomorrow:
1.) Add environment variables for admin password and maybe products table name on amplify
2.) Beautify the UI of the main and admin pages
3.) Add admin page functionality to change name description and consultation packages
4.) This project will further grow into a full fledged website for astrologer
/astro will be /{generic name} and /{generic name}/admin will be in control of that particular astrologer and no one else
5.) /superadmin will verify the astrologers and will be able to add/remove astrologers
(To do all the setup of a new astrologer and maintain and observe the profile of all astrologers)
6.) Products will be different for each astrologer and will be managed by the admin of that particular astrologer (Will I require a seperate table for each astrologer or manage it with same table with a different sort key)
7.)
